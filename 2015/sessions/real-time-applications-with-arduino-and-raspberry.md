speakerBio: "Prof Hon Jean-Daniel Nicoud  has been active, from 1970 till 2000, teaching and doing research on microcomputers applications at the EPFL. He beleived early in the mouse, and Logitech started its successfull activity by selling the mice developped in his lab in 1979. He developped the Smaky family of personal computers, equivalent in performance to the Apple models, from 1976 till 1994. The software of these machines has a PC emulation, see http://infini.smaky.ch/\n\nJDN is still very active developing educational tools and robots within Didel.\n"

sessionTopic: 'Real Time applications'
sessionDescription: "Real time means you can control a quadcopter or a machine tool. You need a 1ms response time and less than 1000 instructions are required to read sensors and decide for the control values for the next 1ms. It’s easy with a 10 MHz micro, but this suppose to understand the microcontroller, use an oscilloscope to check librairie’s response time and rewrite them when not acceptable. Something like Wirth’s law apply to microcontrollers: when the manufacturer double the clock frequency, its system software gets 2 time larger. Linux is great, but not for real time.\nSolution is to use smart peripherals with their own micro, controlled via an I2C channel. Timing constraints and pedagogical interest will be developed in the presentation.\n"
