speakerBio: "I’m a passionate and inspired professional with a multi disciplinary background in the fields of information technology, business and management. I hold a B.Sc. in IT Engineering and an MBA with specialization in international business. I had the opportunity and the privilege to work in different countries (Ireland, Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland) mainly with fast growing start-ups and large enterprises.\n\nI have a very good knowledge of software development practices and agile methodologies. I have worked as a consultant for a business incubator and I have successfully participated to two Startup Weekend events from the Kauffman Foundation in Dublin and Bern, finishing respectively on the 2nd and 3rd place.\n\nHaving had the privilege of working with innovative startups was very useful for the development of my skills. In fact, when I have joined Swissquote Bank, I have organized 2 innovation contests (Battle Dev) where more than 100 employees from different departments and locations were working on innovative ideas for 24 hours.\n\nI have very strong entrepreneurial characteristics and I love to inspire people to do the things that inspire them. I like innovation in every form."
