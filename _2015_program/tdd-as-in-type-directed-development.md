sessionDescription: "Test-Driven Development is widely accepted as good practice. But can we do\nbetter? By specifying your program's behaviour with types, you can go a very\nlong way, with more confidence and with less hassle than with tests.\n\nIn this talk, I will show a new vision of types, explore the fundamental\ndifferences between specifying with types and specifying with tests. I'll talk\nabout how types allow us to prove properties about our program and how\ngenericity is a tremendously powerful tool for specification. He'll show means\nof reasoning based on types and assess specifically what it provides.  Lastly,\nI will show how to complement Type-Directed Development with Test-Driven\nDevelopment to specify with tests what's left after laying out the types.\n"
