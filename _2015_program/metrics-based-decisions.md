Did you ever build a feature that no one used? Or where so sure about your assumptions that you didn’t bother to check if they are correct? Most likely the outcome was unexpected, but from there it’s a small step towards a disaster. All you would need to prevent this is the right data and a helpful metric. 

In the time of big data everyone believes the IT department knows everything. In reality it is a bit different. There you may know exactly how many users with Chrome still use Windows XP but can’t answer how many people use your application once per week.

In this talk you will learn how you can gather data from your users, visualize them in an understandable manner and base your decisions on data rather than assumptions. And we will look how we can respect the privacy of our users while we still get the data we need. The tools you need are available today and include Serilog, Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana.
