sessionDescription: "Poppy Humanoid is the first complete 3D printed open-source and open-hardware humanoid\nrobot. Its 3D printed skeleton is open-hardware (Creative Commons). Its software is open-\nsource (GPL V3), and allows programming beginners as well as advanced roboticists to\ncontrol the robot in Python thanks to the PyPot library (www.poppy-project.org/pypot-\nlibrary/). Software runs on embedded Raspberry Pi 2 computers embedded on the robot, and\nare transparently accessible through remote web interfaces allowing live programming of the\nrobot. Poppy can be also programmed using SCRATCH/SNAP.A physics based simulator (using Vrep) is also\navailable integrating a detailed model of the Poppy Humanoid and Poppy Torso humanoid\nrobots.\_Thanks\n to its modularity, Poppy platform\_allows a wide range of applications \nand experimentations in the fields of education and research. The \nplateform can drastically improves the motivation of pupils and students\n giving them the opportunity to learn through experimentation.\_This\n presentation aims at showing the\_technical aspect of the platform, from\n a hardware point of view to a software point of view.\_We will\_present the different Poppy creatures & explain how can Poppy improves the motivation of\_pupils\_and students.Once\n you would have participated to this session, you will be able to \ninstall the poppy libraries and play with the 3D simulated version of \nthe Poppy project - on your computer ! You will be able to start using \nPoppy project in your classes, use the simulator & the robot to \nexplain sciences, mathematics, and more !"
