sessionTopic: 'In Memory Computing'
sessionDescription: "NoSQL is not just about different storage alternatives such as document store, key value store, graphs or column-based databases. The hardware is also getting much more important. Besides common disks and SSDs, enterprises begin to use in-memory storages more and more because a distributed in-memory data grid provides very fast data access and update. \n\nWhile its performance will vary depending on multiple factors, it is not uncommon to be 100 times faster than corresponding database implementations. For this reason and others described in this session, in-memory computing is a great solution for lifting the burden of big data, reducing reliance on costly transactional systems, and building highly scalable, fault-tolerant applications.\n\nThe session begins with a short introduction to in-memory computing. Afterwards, different frameworks and product alternatives are discussed for implementing in-memory solutions. Finally, the main part of this session shows several different real world uses cases where in-memory computing delivers business value by supercharging the infrastructure, e.g. to accelerate services, handle spikes in processing or ensure fault tolerance and disaster recovery.\n"
