sessionDescription: "Since I joined Raise Partner as the 6th employee and the only IT guy among mathematicians 4 years ago, I have held several positions starting from developper, to head of IT, through consultant, project manager, network administrator, pre-sales, etc.\nFrom my previous experience at an internet major player, my valuable take away was an intensive usage of the scrum methodology which of course I was eager to apply to this new environment where I progressively built the team. Judging from the different projects I have been involved in either as developper, project manager or scrum master (PSMI), scrum could be a weapon representing your best ally as well as the one bringing you the opportunity to shoot your foot with. Several explainations I would like to elaborate on are eligible : project vs product, cultural (composition of the team, clients you deal with), team members background. I would like to share and getting your feedback from my current feeling being torn between getting deeper in the experience and give up scrum in favor of something more traditional. "
