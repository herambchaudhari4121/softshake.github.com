speakerBio: 'Tim runs a small but successful development outfit called Featurist. He has spent many many hours behind a keyboard punching in characters that resemble Vim shortcuts and tiny bits of JavaScript. He has also sworn at his laptop a lot. He still doesn''t understand how to get to the "agile board" in Jira. Fortunately he does know about functional programming, overflow: hidden and when not to use Docker. He''s not good enough (yet) to tell a good abstraction from a bad one, but he does know how to write automated tests for JavaScript applications!!!!'

sessionDescription: "Most websites start off with a little bit of this in them:\n\n    $(\"a.register\").on(\"click\", function(e){\n        $(\"#signup\").fadeToggle(750, \"linear\");\n    });\n\nBut that usually grows into something unmentionable, and with bugs. In this session I'll show you how you can write automated tests for browser applications that run very quickly and very reliably in multiple browsers at once, whatever framework you use. And that means you can turn horrible JavaScript into beautiful JavaScript.\n\nWe'll be using JavaScript, Karma and magic. Lots of DOM elements will be harmed in this presentation.\n"
