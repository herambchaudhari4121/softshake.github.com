speakerBio: 'Tim Macfarlane has been in the programming game since he was just a wee tacker writing adventure games in BASIC when he was 10 using only IF statements. Since then he has come to appreciate the finer points of polymorphism, functional programming and automated testing, and has become addicted to writing programming languages and grumbling about agile project management tools.'

Ever wanted to deploy new features to production several times a day without waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat?

Ever wanted to refactor your way out of a sticky codebase, but weren't sure that you'd be named and shamed by those pernicious testers?

Well now you can with Automated Testing(tm)! But wait, this seems like a lot of hard work, am I doing this right?

This session covers 6 years of experience building and deploying products with very high automated test coverage: the highs, the lows and the tradeoffs.
