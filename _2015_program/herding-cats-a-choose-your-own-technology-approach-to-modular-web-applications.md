sessionTopic: 'Frontend Architecture'
sessionDescription: "Using MVC technologies such as AngularJS and React, it is easy to create web applications quickly. These technologies or the upcoming web components even allow for encapsulation and reuse of UI controls.\n\nBut how to isolate and reuse actual business value? Eventually, this is what matters to your users and customers. How to recombine the building blocks time after time, while maintaining a solid overall experience? With LaxarJS, we apply proven concepts from the server world to the web frontend: reactive systems that use publish/subscribe for communication allow for decoupling of components and isolating local state.\n\nWe'd like to introduce you to LaxarJS as a \"Middleware for your Web Client\", helping you to integrate components independent of implementation technologies or frameworks that they might use.
