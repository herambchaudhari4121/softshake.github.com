sessionDescription: "Years ago, I had a project idea: Develop a robot to automatically play a moto racing mobile phone game. But I had no idea how to start, and as many other projects, it just didn't happen...\nThen one day... I bought an Arduino Starter Kit: From that moment, the project really started and nothing would stop it!\n\nDiscover how BeatTheBotChallenge (http://www.github.com/dbolkensteyn/BeatTheBotChallenge) was built in a few months, mostly from the Lausanne <-> Genève train.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn a little bit about many thing: Computer Vision and OpenCV, Woodworking, C++, how it feels to present at the New York World Maker Faire and much more!"
