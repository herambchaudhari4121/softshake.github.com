sessionTopic: 'DevOps, Continous Delivery'
sessionDescription: "The cost of a change within an IT project impacts all the departments and specifically the integration projects where we have to link many differents systems, play with different protocols and formats. This why a DevOps strategy to manage this change, as to deliver the modifications from the development to the production environement is critical to guarantee the success/profitability of a project and to simplify the maintenance process too. Such strategy will naturaly support a more agile development model, reduce the costs and will allow new business requirements to be adopted more frequently.\n\nTo sustain this vision and architecture paradigm the opensource Fabric8 project has developed some continuous delivery tools (Maven Plugin, API) around the Docker container & Google Kubernetes API to manage the required applications part of the DevOps strategy : Jenkins Jobs & DSL, Gerrit for code review, Gogs / Gitlab to host the git repositories and Nexus to manage the artefacts.\n\nIn this session, we'll present and demystify the technology used and we will demonstrate based on a simple integration project (Apache Camel REST service), how we could manage it from dev to integration by adopting the DevOps principe and by deploying using the Fabric8 tools the required applications.\n\n"
