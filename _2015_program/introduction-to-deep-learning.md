sessionDescription: "Deep learning methods, capable of processing large amounts of data in its raw form and allowing for replacing engineering of feature descriptors by learning hierarchies of efficient data representations, have recently dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, as well as in object detection, recognition and localization in images and videos, reaching or, in some cases, even surpassing human-level performance.\nConvolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have excelled on numerous scientific competitions involving visual information, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs), capable of processing sequences of inputs, have significantly advanced natural language understanding, speech transcription and machine translation. \nSpreading beyond the artificial intelligence community, deep learning has already provided new insights in physics, astronomy, biology, genetics and chemistry, and this process only accelerates. A number of hardware companies, such as NVIDIA, Intel, Samsung and Qualcomm, are developing specifically designed chips to enable real-time deep learning for vision and audio applications on mobile platforms, ranging from smartphones to self-driving cars.\nIn this talk, I will give a short overview of history of deep learning research in the past years and cover the basic functionality of classical deep learning models, such as fully connected and convolutional neural networks, as well as their dynamic extensions. The second part of the talk will summarize main research directions of deep learning labs at Google, Facebook, Microsoft Research, etc., and cover the most interesting existing algorithms involving visual, audio and text data in different contexts.\n"
